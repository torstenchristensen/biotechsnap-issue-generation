Co-founded by Dr. L√©a Wenger, who was diagnosed with the disease during her PhD, the startup flips traditional drug development by focusing not on what happens inside cells, but on how their environment drives disease. With this new approach, Cyclana aims to reverse tissue scarring involved in endometriosis and potentially expand their technology to other chronic inflammatory conditions.<br><br>Enjoy today's read!<br><br>---Joachim E.<br><br><em>Don't keep this newsletter a secret: Forward the Snap to a friend!</em><br><br><em>Was this email forwarded to you?</em> <a href=\"https://www.biotechsnap.com/subscribe\" style=\"color: #007bff; text-decoration: underline;\">Sign up here.</a>"
